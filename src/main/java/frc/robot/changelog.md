Programmers! This is the format that your commit messages need to be in. If we cannot handle real commit messages, then 
we will just have to have an actual paper trail of changes that get made that go through Benny. Copy the below text, and make it
fit your message. Try to make many smaller commits instead of one large big commit. Make your messages detailed but somewhat short,
focusing on detail.

- File(s) Changed / Changes Made (Detailed) / Name of contributor (First & Last) / MM.DD.YY -

An example commit message would be:

- Vision.java / Added two methods for calculating position to Vision.java / Mateo Johnson / 01.01.01 -
